# BarSorter
Google Script designed for bartenders to automate monthly salary deductions

## Usage
Create a new google form with the following template:

Make sure that the form is placing all responses in a spreadsheet, then get the url to this spreadsheet and place it in the index.html file as "spreadsheeturl".

I'm going to assume that if you are using this you know how to create a google script so I will not walk you through that, but comment if you need help.
